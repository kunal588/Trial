# WorkStreet API

This is the developement of backend api for our workstreet application. This API is going to support user authentication, sigup and login.

## Documentation

I have install some dependencies which I think would be required.So install them using **npm install**. Then to start the server use **npx nodemon file_name** or **npm start** and you are ready to go.

For developement I encourage to install Thundar Client extension in _VS CODE_
